#SlideSync



##History
The goal is to create a presentation program
that allows you to display the same content on your viewers' devices. Just direct your viewers to the
presentation's URL or QR code, and whenever you change slides, their devices change as well.


As of Fall Semester 2014 (November-December) SlideSync is actively being worked on. If we are still super
pumped about it, one or both of us will continue working on it. 

When we successfully implement new functionality, we deploy it to [a Meteor server](http://slidesync.meteor.com). Go check that out if you want to see how it works without running the code yourself.

##Installation
**Prerequisite** : Meteor is already installed. 
See [Meteor official website](https://www.meteor.com/install).

**Clone the repository and run the project locally on localhost:3000 :**
```
git clone https://github.com/SlideSyncOrg/SlideSync.git
cd SlideSync
meteor
```


##Futur
If you want to see what features we are planning on working on, check out our
